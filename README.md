# ChatGPT Travel Sass

This bot uses ChatGPT underneath to lay out a travel itinerary from point A to point B via point C when starting on a particular date.

### How to Start

Clone the project, cd to the project folder. Create a `dotenv` file and add your API key with key name, OPENAI_APIKEY, from Open AI in it.

Open two terminals. Firstly, give command `npm init` to load the node_modules folder. Give command `node server.js` in one terminal. This will start the backend server.

In the second terminal, give command `npm start` to start the frontend. This will start the project.
